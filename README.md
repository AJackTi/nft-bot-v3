| LOG_LEVEL                                    | Sets the level at which the bot should log. Valid values are: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `verbose`, `debug`. Using `debug` will produce a massive amount of output and is not suggested except for initial setup or problem solving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ENABLE_FS_LOGGING                            | Whether or not log messages should be output to a log file. This will log into a `.logs/<utc-date>` directory each time the bot is started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| FAILED_ORDER_TRIGGER_TIMEOUT_SEC             | How long the bot should wait before it will retry an order after it has failed to successfully process on chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| OPEN_TRADES_REFRESH_SEC                      | How frequently the bot should fully refresh trade data from the Gains smart contracts on chain. By default, the bot is keeping itself up to date based on delta events it's receiving from the chain so this isn't technically necessary, but it's a good fail safe in case the bot fails to hear about a certain even due to connectivity or other issues. Setting this to `0` will disable explicit refreshing and only ever keep state based on events it receives. |
| GAS_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC                     | How frequently to get the latest gas prices from the gas station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| FETCH_TRADING_VARIABLES_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SEC | How frequently trading variables should be refreshed from the Gains smart contracts on chain. There are many variables that go into the calculations of triggering order and these variables need to be freshed to ensure the bot is always using the latest numbers. This is always done at start up, but does not need to be done too frequently at runtime.                                                                                                         |
| DRY_RUN                                      | Set to `true` to enable a "dry run" mode where the bot will do everything except submit the actual transactions to the chain for processing. This is good for initial setup to ensure everything is working as expected and other testing combined with a `LOG_LEVEL` of `debug`.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CHAIN_ID                                     | The ID of the block chain the bot is going to be interacting with. This defaults to `137` for Polygon's `mainnet` and you should only need to change it if you're targeting another chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| NETWORK_ID                                   | The ID of the network of the block chain the bot is going to be interacting with. This defaults to `137` for Polygon's `mainnet` and you should only need to change it if you're targeting another chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| CHAIN                                        | The name of the block chain the bot is going to be interacting with. This defaults to `mainnet` and you should only change it if you're targeting a different chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| BASE_CHAIN                                   | The name of the base block chain the bot is going to be interacting with. This only needs to be set if you're testing on a network that is forked from a different chain. (e.g. testing on Polygon's Mumbai you would set this to `goerli`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| HARDFORK                                     | The ethereum hardfork of the block chain the bot is going to be interacting with. This defaults to `london` today and you should only need to change it if you're intending to target a different hardfork.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| USE_MULTICALL                                | Whether or not the bot should multicall fetching open orders and other information. Some RPC providers may restrict multicalls. Set to `false` to use call batching instead. Defaults to `true`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| MAX_RETRIES                                  | How many times the bot should attempt to trigger an order. Set to `-1` to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ORACLE_ADDRESS                                             | **FOR ORACLE OPERATORS ONLY:** The address of your oracle. The `PUBLIC_KEY` you use to run the bot must either be an authorized fulfiller or the owner of the oracle contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
